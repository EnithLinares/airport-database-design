# Airport Database Design

This project aims to determine how I learn and implement new technologies and tackle real-life challenges.
For this exercise, I am using PostgreSQL to create a database for an airport system that supports airlines, passengers and cargo tracking. The data used comes from the **SFO Air Traffic Statistics** dataset.

## Deliverables

-   Relational Schema

    -   Create tables with relationships for airlines, flights, terminals, passengers, and cargo
    -   Clearly outline primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity

-   Data Incorporation

    -   Integrate the SFO Air Traffic Statistics dataset from Kaggle
    -   Decide how you will handle data cleaning or any transformations needed
    -   Add additional rows as needed for all the additional tables created so that a wide variety of data is available.

-   Complex SQL Queries

    -   Implement at least five complex queries that showcase analytical capabilities (e.g., aggregations, groupings, joins, subqueries)
    -   Document each query’s purpose and what insights it provides.

-   Installation & Testing
    -   Install PostgreSQL locally (if you haven’t already).
    -   Develop and test your solution thoroughly to ensure it runs without errors.

### Data Relationships

### Data Normalizing

To ensure the quality of the data and make sure only the relevant information, **Excel** was used to normalize the dataset.
